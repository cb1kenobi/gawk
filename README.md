Gawk is a observable model that wraps JavaScript data types. Once a JavaScript
value is gawked, you can listen for changes including deeply nested changes.

Only arrays and objects can be gawked. All other types are passed through.

> Note: gawk uses ES2015 proxies and thus requires Node.js 6 or newer.

## Installation

    npm install gawk

## Examples

```javascript
import gawk from 'gawk';

const obj = gawk({
    foo: 'bar'
});

gawk.watch(obj, evt => {
    console.info('object changed!');
    console.info('new value =', evt.target);
});

obj.foo = 'baz';

console.info(obj); // { foo: 'baz' }
```

You can also be notified if a deep child is changed:

```javascript
const obj = gawk({
    foo: {
        bar: ['a', 'b']
    }
});

gawk.watch(obj, evt => {
    console.info('object changed!');
    console.info('new value =', evt.target);
});

obj.foo.bar.push('c', 'd');

console.info(obj); // { foo: { bar: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] } }
```
