Gawk is a observable model that wraps JavaScript data types. Once a JavaScript
value is wrapped, it allows you to listen for changes. You can observe deeply
nested objects too.

Gawk supports the common built-in data types such as string, boolean, number,
array, object, function, null, and undefined. Anything that you can represent
in a JSON object, you can gawk.

Gawked arrays, objects, and functions have unique methods for common tasks. For
example, `GawkArray` instances have `push()` and `pop()` methods.

> Note: gawk requires Node.js 4 or newer.

## Installation

    npm install gawk

## Examples

```javascript
import { gawk } from 'gawk';
// or if you're using CommonJS:
// const gawk = require('gawk').gawk;

const obj = gawk({
    foo: 'bar'
});

obj.watch(evt => {
    console.info('object changed!');
    console.info('new value =', evt.target.toJS());
});

obj.set('foo', 'baz');

console.info(obj.toJS()); // { foo: 'baz' }
```

You can also be notified if a deep child is changed:

```javascript
const obj = gawk({
    foo: {
        bar: ['a', 'b']
    }
});

obj.watch(evt => {
    console.info('object changed!');
    console.info('new value =', evt.target.toJS());
});

obj.get(['foo', 'bar']).push('c', 'd');

console.info(obj.toJS()); // { foo: { bar: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] } }
```
