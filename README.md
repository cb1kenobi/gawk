Gawk wraps JavaScript objects and arrays making them observable. Once a
JavaScript value is gawked, you can listen for changes including deeply nested
changes. Only objects and arrays can be gawked. All other types are passed
through.

Gawked objects and arrays can be interacted with as if they were regular
objects/arrays. Built-in functions such as `JSON.stringify()` work as expected.

> Note: gawk uses ES2015 proxies and thus requires Node.js 6 or newer.

## Installation

    npm install gawk

## Examples

```javascript
import gawk from 'gawk';

const obj = gawk({
    foo: 'bar'
});

gawk.watch(obj, target => {
    console.info('object changed!');
    console.info('new value =', target);
});

obj.foo = 'baz';

console.info(obj); // { foo: 'baz' }
```

You can also be notified if a deep child is changed:

```javascript
const obj = gawk({
    foo: {
        bar: ['a', 'b']
    }
});

gawk.watch(obj, target => {
    console.info('object changed!');
    console.info('new value =', target);
});

obj.foo.bar.push('c', 'd');

console.info(obj); // { foo: { bar: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] } }
```

You can also directly create `GawkObject` and `GawkArray` objects:

```javascript
import { GawkArray, GawkObject } from 'gawk';

const obj = new GawkObject({ foo: 'bar' });
const arr = new GawkArray('a', 'b', 'c');
```

## Upgrading to v3

Gawk v3 has dropped all gawk data types except `GawkArray` and `GawkObject`.

Since Gawk v3 uses ES6 Proxies, you no longer need to call `obj.get()`,
`obj.set()`, `obj.delete()`, etc.

Methods `obj.watch()`, `obj.merge()`, and `obj.mergeDeep()` have moved to
`gawk.watch()`, `gawk.merge()`, and `gawk.mergeDeep()`. The first argument must
be a gawk object.

Gawk v3 no longer hashes values. This means speed. Gawk v3 is about 19 times
faster than v1 and v2.
